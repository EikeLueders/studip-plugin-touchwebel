###
A function combinator that makes ensures that the callback is only
valid for authorised users. Otherwise `redirect` to the #login page.
###
requireSession = () ->
  (callback) ->
    ->
      if tw.$Session.authenticated()
        callback.apply(this, arguments)
      else
        @navigate "login", trigger: true



###
The singleton AppRouter containing the handlers for all the routes.
###
tw.router.AppRouter = Backbone.Router.extend

  ###
  @firstPage is used to prevent sliding in the first page.
  ###
  initialize: () ->
    @firstPage = true

  routes:
    "":           "home"
    "home":       "home"
    "login":      "login"
    "my-courses": "myCourses"
    "course/:id": "course"

  ###
  Authorised route changing page to a HomeView.
  ###
  home:
    requireSession() \
    ->
      @changePage new tw.ui.HomeView()

  ###
  Authorised route changing page to a MyCoursesView.

  It instantiates a course collection, changes the page to the
  MyCoursesView (parameterized with that collection) and fetches the
  collection from the server. (In the process the view gets notified
  and renders itself.)
  ###
  myCourses:
    requireSession() \
    ->
      courses = new tw.model.Courses()
      courses.fetch()
      @changePage new tw.ui.MyCoursesView(collection: courses)

  ###
  Just a dummy, authorised route handler. To be continued â€¦
  ###
  course:
    requireSession() \
    (id) ->
      alert "Show course: '#{id}'"

  ###
  Authorised route changing page to a HomeView.
  ###
  login:
    () ->
      @changePage new tw.ui.LoginView()

  ###
  Internal function to be used by the route handlers.

  `page` is a Backbone.View which is added as a jQuery mobile page to
  the pageContainer. Eventually, after all the setup mojo and
  everything is in place, the `jQuery mobile way`(TM) of changing
  pages is invoked.
  ###
  changePage: (page) ->
    $(page.el).attr('data-role', 'page')
    page.render()
    $('body').append $ page.el
    transition = $.mobile.defaultPageTransition

    if @firstPage
      transition = 'none'
      @firstPage = false

    $.mobile.changePage $ page.el,
      changeHash: false
      transition: transition
